                        <p className="content-text-18">The science of understanding people has developed for centuries, but not enough has been done to integrate these approaches into the process of the digital world, especially software design. 
                        For more than a decade, we studied people and cognitive studies to understand not only the person, but understand the unconscious mind. These studies have lead us to a refined, repeatable and flexible methodology that centers 
                        on answering questions through interviews and through direct customer observational fieldwork to identify people’s needs, behaviors and aspirations. This provides a perspective on customers that clients typically have never seen.</p>
                        <p className="content-text-18">The aim of this work is not more data, but for an understanding. We create a strategy for the experience that the software design will provide. 
                        It's a framework that allows developers, designers, marketers and architects to make decisions that support the intended customer experience. integrated offering takes 
                        insights from the field and manifests them in a designed software user interface that engages customers and improves business results.</p>
