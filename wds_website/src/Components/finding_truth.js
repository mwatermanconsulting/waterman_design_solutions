                    At the beginning of the methodology, WDS sets the foundation for success by developing an
                            understanding of the business, the industry, the competition and relevant trends. This is the basis for how subsequent phases are approached, which includes secondary research, interviewing stakeholders and subject matter experts in order to gain a first-hand awareness of the company context and build connections within the business. This contributes to stakeholder alignment throughout the engagement and begins to define a hypothesis for where the company intends to play in the market, who it intends to serve and how it plans to serve them.

Personas keep the focus on real people who exhibit unique sets of characteristics, which  assists the team throughout ideation, design and marketing to help them develop appropriate solutions and messages.</p>

                            These cognitive states represent a model of what is in people’s minds as they do their work, their mental model. This understanding has implications for both design and marketing.</p>

This understanding also provides input to marketing by providing key information for creating a communication plan that resonates with customers. </p>
